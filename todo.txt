REMINDER:

-all functions which modify the grid/audioledger/etc in visualizer should call fileSavedUpdate(FALSE)

TODO:



-implement all comments labelled TODO in visualizer.c

-implement audio list storage in text files. Audio files in the input folder should be listed in AUDIO_LEDGER.txt, and any audio files you want the simulator to create in the output folder should be listed in AUDIO_OUT_LEDGER.txt, like so:

input folder:

AUDIO_LEDGER.txt
---
5 5 5 audioIn.wav
0 1 1 audioIn2.wav
---

AUDIO_OUT_LEDGER.txt
---
3 3 3 audioOut
---


output folder(after running simulator):

AUDIO_LEDGER.txt
---
3 3 3 audioOut.wav
---

-add audio sources and outputs to visualizer

-implement new equation in simulator

-create icon for visualizer

-simulator could use getopt to check command line inputs. and should use the flags indicated in the visualizer.c header
