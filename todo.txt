REMINDER:

-all functions which modify the grid/audioledger/etc in visualizer should call fileSavedUpdate(FALSE)

TODO:

-implement all comments labelled TODO in visualizer.c

-implement audio output to files

-implement audio list storage in text files. Audio files in the input folder should be listed in AUDIO_LEDGER.txt, and any audio files you want the simulator to create in the output folder should be listed in AUDIO_OUT_LEDGER.txt, like so:

input folder:

AUDIO_LEDGER.txt
---
5 5 5 audioIn.wav
0 1 1 audioIn2.wav
---

AUDIO_OUT_LEDGER.txt
---
3 3 3 audioOut
---


output folder(after running simulator):

AUDIO_LEDGER.txt
---
3 3 3 audioOut.wav
---

-implement new equation in simulator

-create icon for visualizer

-add audio sources and outputs to visualizer

-optimize audio loading/downloading part of algorithm: load audio frames before algorithm runs, pass all audio values in at once via array with 1 thread per value, or just memcpy them to device before running(don't copy the entire audio file, just enough so it has <timesteps> amount of frames).

-visualizer should have new function appendCommandLineFlagInt which appends a command line flag with an integer option

-simulator should use getopt to check command line inputs. and should use the flags indicated in the visualizer.c header
